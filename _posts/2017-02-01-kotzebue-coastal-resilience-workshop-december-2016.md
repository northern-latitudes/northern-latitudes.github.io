Alaska’s coastal communities, nearly all of which are already experiencing the impacts of rapid change, are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. On December 7 and 8, a group of community leaders from the Arctic region, along with scientists, natural resource managers, and planners, gathered in Kotzebue to identify tools and solutions to address these challenges. As part of a series of coastal resilience workshops being held around the state, this event was an opportunity to network, share ideas and strategies, and maximize collective efforts. In addition, nearly 300 Alaskans have been contributing to the creation of a coastal resilience toolbox – an “open source” set of practices, resources, local case studies, and ideas for dealing with erosion, sea level rise and other threats to coastal areas of Alaska.
